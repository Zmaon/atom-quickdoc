# quickdoc package

Use Ctrl-Shift-d (or the command Quickdoc:Lookup) to open documentation for the current word in your browser.

For now, it supports PHP, jQuery and any other language through devdocs.io

PLEASE HELP! You can contribute by adding the base URLs for different programming languages in config.json.

You can also set your special custom search settings directly in the settings of the package.
